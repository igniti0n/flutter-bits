Like some other [collections](https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter_vignettes) this repo is designed to contain multiple flutter projects (one project per sample).

## Contributing

- Go to the root of the project and create new sample by creating new flutter project `flutter create my_new_flutter_bit`
- Write the code inside that project and keep in mind that purpose of that code is to be read by others, so keep it nice and clean.
- Write the README inside your project and explain in short what is it and how everything works. Include the video or screenshot if the feature can be visually represented.
- Reduce your dependencies to minimum. List them all in README and explain why are they needed.
